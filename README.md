    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    
    The best way to interpret a User's needs and implement them into a program is to put yourself in the User's shoes and 
    imagine what they would require to succeed. A user story helps provide that background to a piece of functionality. By having a user story a developer can put themselves in the User's shoes and begin brainstorming additional ways to provide additional value to the user.
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    
    When developing I like to deliver base functionality first then move forward. I would like to incorporate more refactoring into my development style. I spend too much time tunneling problems and delivering Final Drafts of work rather then creating small samples of quickly delivered work.
    
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    
    To be a good team member is to deliver your best work. To take pride in the work you put forward and to deliver better product for the user and team. Good team members do their best to deliver value to the project. They are also able to express ideas openly and without fear to put forward better solutions for the project.
