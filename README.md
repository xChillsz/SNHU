Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The Inventory Application I developed required the following:
  -User Login Page
  -Database Implementation
  -The ability for users to Add/Remove & Edit Inventory Items and their total counts
  -The ability to notify users of low inventory counts.
    
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The following screens and features were necessary for the User:
  -User Login & Welcome Page: Used for user login & welcome.
  -Inventory Page: Used to manage inventory items.
  -User Profile Page: Used to manage user settings.

My UI was designed to make it easy for a user to navigate and interact with the system. While providing security needed for a user to manage their inventory. The Design was successful because it was kept simple and met all the acceptance criteria outlined by the client.
    
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The approach I used while coding my application was to pre-plan all necessary steps. By preplanning the UI Design, Functionality and Database tables. I was able to set up classes and interfaces that aligned with what I was trying to achieve much quicker. I would use these strategies in the future because pre-planning makes things easier for the development process.
    
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

When testing my code I spend time troubleshooting functionality as it was implemented. Small unit tests allowed me to keep the process moving forward without having to troubleshoot every piece but just the most recent piece of code.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

There were moments when pre-planning was a lot more detailed than what I could provide. A way I "innovated" was by cutting some functionality out and focusing on what was required. It's good to know what is deliverable and what isn't this way if the client requires more we have the plans for that functionality already set up and in most cases that means we've built the system for scalability in the future.
    
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I really enjoyed creating a dynamic populated row and column table structure that works off database entries. I think it really showed how dynamic I could develop functionality and the grasp I havve on the capabilities of the system.
